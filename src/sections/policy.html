        We are very delighted that you have shown interest in our enterprise. Data protection is of a particularly
        high priority for the management of the Agentur Baumeister. The use of the Internet pages of the Agentur
        Baumeister is possible without any indication of personal data; however, if a data subject wants to use special
        enterprise services via our website, processing of personal data could become necessary. If the processing of
        personal data is necessary and there is no statutory basis for such processing, we generally obtain consent from
        the data subject.
         <br>
        <span>
        The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a data
        subject shall always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with the
        country-specific data protection regulations applicable to the Agentur Baumeister. By means of this data
        protection declaration, our enterprise would like to inform the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose
        of the personal data we collect, use and process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed, by means of this data
        protection declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled.
        </span>
        <br/>
        <span>
        As the controller, the Agentur Baumeister has implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to
        ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through this website. However, Internet-based
        data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed. For this
        reason, every data subject is free to transfer personal data to us via alternative means, e.g. by telephone.

           3. Collection of general data and information
           <br/>
           The website of the Agentur Baumeister collects a series of general data and information when a data subject or automated system calls up the website. 
           This general data and information are stored in the server log files. Collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, 
           (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Internet site, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), 
           (7) the Internet service provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information technology systems.
           <br/>
           When using these general data and information, the Agentur Baumeister does not draw any conclusions about the data subject. Rather, 
           this information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our website correctly, (2) optimize the content of our website as well as its advertisement, 
           (3) ensure the long-term viability of our information technology systems and website technology, and (4) provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal prosecution in case of a cyber-attack. 
           Therefore, the Agentur Baumeister analyzes anonymously collected data and information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. 
           The anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.
           <br/>
           4. Routine erasure and blocking of personal data
           <br/>
          The data controller shall process and store the personal data of the data subject only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of storage, or as far as this is granted by the European legislator or other legislators in laws or regulations to which the controller is subject to.
          If the storage purpose is not applicable, or if a storage period prescribed by the European legislator or another competent legislator expires, the personal data are routinely blocked or erased in accordance with legal requirements.

          6. Data protection provisions about the application and use of Instagram
          <br/>
          On this website, the controller has integrated components of the service Instagram. Instagram is a
          <br/> 
          service that may be qualified as an audiovisual platform, which allows users to share photos and videos, 
          <br/>
          as well as disseminate such data in other social networks.
          <br/>
          The operating company of the services offered by Instagram is Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal
          <br/> 
          Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2 Ireland.
          <br/>
          With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the controller
          <br/> 
          and on which an Instagram component (Insta button) was integrated, the Internet browser on the 
          <br/>
          information technology system of the data subject is automatically prompted to the download of a 
          <br/>
          display of the corresponding Instagram component of Instagram. During the course of this technical
          <br/>
          procedure, Instagram becomes aware of what specific sub-page of our website was visited by the data 
          <br/>
          subject.
          <br/>
          If the data subject is logged in at the same time on Instagram, Instagram detects with every call-up to 
          <br/>
          our website by the data subject—and for the entire duration of their stay on our Internet site—which
          <br/> 
          specific sub-page of our Internet page was visited by the data subject. This information is collected 
          <br/>
          through the Instagram component and is associated with the respective Instagram account of the data 
          <br/>
          subject. If the data subject clicks on one of the Instagram buttons integrated on our website, then 
          <br/>
          Instagram matches this information with the personal Instagram user account of the data subject and
          <br/> 
          stores the personal data.
          <br/>
          Instagram receives information via the Instagram component that the data subject has visited our
          <br/>
          website provided that the data subject is logged in at Instagram at the time of the call to our website. 
          <br/>
          This occurs regardless of whether the person clicks on the Instagram button or not. If such a transmission 
          <br/>
          of information to Instagram is not desirable for the data subject, then he or she can prevent this by
          <br/>
          logging off from their Instagram account before a call-up to our website is made.
          <br/>

         The controller has integrated components of the LinkedIn Corporation on this website. LinkedIn is a 
         <br/>
         web-based social network that enables users with existing business contacts to connect and to make 
         <br/>
         new business contacts.Over 400 million registered people in more than 200 countries use LinkedIn. 
          <br/>
          Thus,LinkedIn is currently the largest platform for business contacts and one of the most visited 
          <br/>
          websites in the world.

         <br/>
         and on which a LinkedIn component (LinkedIn plug-in) was integrated, the Internet browser on the 
         <br/>
         information technology system of the data subject is automatically prompted to the download of a
         <br/>
         display of the corresponding LinkedIn component of LinkedIn. Further information about the LinkedIn 
         <br/>
         plug-in may be accessed under https://developer.linkedin.com/plugins. During the course of this 
         <br/>
         technical procedure, LinkedIn gains knowledge of what specific sub-page of our website was visited by 
         <br/>
         the data subject.
         <br/>
         If the data subject is logged in at the same time on LinkedIn, LinkedIn detects with every call-up to our 
         <br/>
         website by the data subject—and for the entire duration of their stay on our Internet site—which specific 
         <br/>
         sub-page of our Internet page was visited by the data subject. This information is collected through the 
         <br/>
         LinkedIn component and associated with the respective LinkedIn account of the data subject. If the data 
         <br/>
         subject clicks on one of the LinkedIn buttons integrated on our website, then LinkedIn assigns this 
         <br/>
         information to the personal LinkedIn user account of the data subject and stores the personal data.
         <br/>
        LinkedIn receives information via the LinkedIn component that the data subject has visited our website, 
        <br/>
        provided that the data subject is logged in at LinkedIn at the time of the call-up to our website. This
        <br/> 
        occurs regardless of whether the person clicks on the LinkedIn button or not. If such a transmission of 
        <br/>
        information to LinkedIn is not desirable for the data subject, then he or she may prevent this by logging 
        <br/>
        ff from their LinkedIn account before a call-up to our website is made.
        <br/>
        LinkedIn provides under https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/guest-controls the possibility to unsubscribe
        <br/> 
        from e-mail messages, SMS messages and targeted ads, as well as the ability to manage ad settings.

       8. Legal basis for the processing
       <br/>
       Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a 
       <br/>
       specific processing purpose.If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a 
       <br/>
       contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case,for example, when processing operations are 
       <br/>
       necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1)
       <br/> 
       lit. b GDPR.The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-
       <br/>
       contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services.Is our
       <br/> 
       company subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for 
       <br/>
       the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR. In rare cases,the processing
       <br/> 
       of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural 
       <br/>
       person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his name, age, 
       <br/>
       health insurance data or other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor,hospital or 
       <br/>
       other third party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR. Finally,processing 
       <br/>
       operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations
       <br/> 
       which are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds,if processing is necessary for the 
       <br/>
       purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party,except where such 
       <br/>
       interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which
       <br/> 
       require protection of personal data.Such processing operations are particularly permissible because 
       <br/>
       they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator.He considered that a legitimate 
       <br/>
       interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).

         <br/>
         into a contract; Obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data; possible consequences of 
         <br/>
         failure to provide such data
         <br/>
         We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g. tax regulations) or can also 
         <br/>
         result from contractual provisions (e.g. information on the contractual partner). Sometimes it may be 
         <br/>
         necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject provides us with personal data, which must 
         <br/>
         subsequently be processed by us. The data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with personal
         <br/>
          data when our company signs a contract with him or her. The non-provision of the personal data would 
          <br/>
          have the consequence that the contract with the data subject could not be concluded. Before personal 
          <br/>
          data is provided by the data subject, the data subject must contact any employee. The employee 
          <br/>
          clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or contract or 
          <br/>
          is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal 
          <br/>
          data and the consequences of non-provision of the personal data.
