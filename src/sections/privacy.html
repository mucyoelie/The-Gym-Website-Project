        We are very delighted that you have shown interest in our enterprise. Data protection is of a particularly
        high priority for the management of the Agentur Baumeister. The use of the Internet pages of the Agentur
        Baumeister is possible without any indication of personal data; however, if a data subject wants to use special
        enterprise services via our website, processing of personal data could become necessary. If the processing of
        personal data is necessary and there is no statutory basis for such processing, we generally obtain consent from
        the data subject.
        <br>
      <span>
        The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a data
        subject shall always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with the
        country-specific data protection regulations applicable to the Agentur Baumeister. By means of this data
        protection declaration, our enterprise would like to inform the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose
        of the personal data we collect, use and process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed, by means of this data
        protection declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled.
    </span>
    <br/>
      <span>
        As the controller, the Agentur Baumeister has implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to
        ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through this website. However, Internet-based
        data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed. For this
        reason, every data subject is free to transfer personal data to us via alternative means, e.g. by telephone.
    </span>
      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">1. Definitions</h3>
      <p class="text-[24px]">
        The data protection declaration of the Agentur Baumeister is based on the terms used by the European legislator
        for the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our data protection declaration should be
        legible and understandable for the general public, as well as our customers and business partners. To ensure
        this, we would like to first explain the terminology used. In this data protection declaration, we use, inter
        alia, the following terms:
        <br/>
        <span>
        . a)	Personal data Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”). 
          An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, 
          location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
        </span>
        <br/>
        <span>
        . b) Data subject Data subject is any identified or identifiable natural person, whose personal data is processed by the controller responsible for the processing.
        </span>
        <br/>
        <span>
          . c)	Processing Processing is any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data,
           whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, 
           consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.
        </span>
        <br/>
        <span>
         . d)	Restriction of processing Restriction of processing is the marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting their processing in the future.
        </span>
        <br/>
        <span>
         . e)	Profiling Profiling means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person,
          in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements.
        </span>
      <br/>
      <span>
        . f) 	Pseudonymisation Pseudonymisation is the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, 
        provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.
      </span>
      <br/>
      <span>
        . g)	Controller or controller responsible for the processing 
        <br/>Controller or controller responsible for the processing is the natural or legal person, 
        public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, 
        the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law.
      </span>
      <br/>
      <span>
      . h)	Processor
      <br/> Processor is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller.
      </span>
      <br/>
      <span>
        . i)  	Recipient 
        <br/>Recipient is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, 
        to which the personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not. However, public authorities which may receive personal data in the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance with Union or Member State law shall not be regarded as recipients;
         the processing of those data by those public authorities shall be in compliance with the applicable data protection rules according to the purposes of the processing.
      </span>
      <br>
      <span>
        . j)  	Third party 
        <br/>Third party is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the data subject, controller, 
        processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data.
      </span>
      <br/>
      <span>
        . k)	Consent 
        <br/>Consent of the data subject is any freely given, specific, 
        informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.

           3. Collection of general data and information
           <br/>
           The website of the Agentur Baumeister collects a series of general data and information when a data subject or automated system calls up the website. 
           This general data and information are stored in the server log files. Collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, 
           (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Internet site, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), 
           (7) the Internet service provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information technology systems.
           <br/>
           When using these general data and information, the Agentur Baumeister does not draw any conclusions about the data subject. Rather, 
           this information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our website correctly, (2) optimize the content of our website as well as its advertisement, 
           (3) ensure the long-term viability of our information technology systems and website technology, and (4) provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal prosecution in case of a cyber-attack. 
           Therefore, the Agentur Baumeister analyzes anonymously collected data and information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. 
           The anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.
           <br/>
           4. Routine erasure and blocking of personal data
           <br/>
          The data controller shall process and store the personal data of the data subject only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of storage, or as far as this is granted by the European legislator or other legislators in laws or regulations to which the controller is subject to.
          If the storage purpose is not applicable, or if a storage period prescribed by the European legislator or another competent legislator expires, the personal data are routinely blocked or erased in accordance with legal requirements.
          <br/>
          5. Rights of the data subject
          <br>
         <span class="relative left-4">
          . a) Right of confirmation
